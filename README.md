# Johno's Neovim Config

My Neovim configuration for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.com), purpose-built for TypeScript and Go development with Claude as a first-class citizen.

## Why This Exists

Some people meditate. Some do yoga. I open Neovim, fire up Claude, and write Go and TypeScript until the world makes sense again. This is my happy place -- a terminal where keystrokes are cheap, feedback loops are tight, and the AI pair programmer never judges my variable names.

There's a certain poetry to it: Go for when you want the compiler to hold your hand, TypeScript for when you want the type system to argue with you, and Claude for when you want someone to tell you that your approach is "interesting" before gently suggesting you rewrite the whole thing. Neovim ties it all together like the world's most opinionated glue.

I've tried other setups. I've clicked through menus. I've dragged and dropped. I've used mice like some kind of animal. But nothing beats the flow of modal editing, instant AI assistance, and a config that loads faster than you can say "VS Code is updating." If the terminal is home, this config is the furniture.

## What's Inside

- **[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)** -- because life's too short to configure everything from scratch, but too long to use someone else's config without tweaking it
- **[claudecode.nvim](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/packages/claudecode.nvim)** -- Claude Code integration, right in the editor. `<leader>ac` and you're pair programming with an AI that actually reads your code
- **LSP + Mason** -- language servers managed properly, so Go and TypeScript just work
- **Treesitter** -- syntax highlighting that understands your code, not just your brackets
- **[nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) + [nvim-dap-view](https://github.com/igorlfs/nvim-dap-view) + [nvim-dap-go](https://github.com/leoluz/nvim-dap-go)** -- delve-powered Go debugging with a minimalist inspection panel. Breakpoints, step controls, watches, attach-to-process, and debug-test-under-cursor
- **[worktree.nvim](https://github.com/yongjohnlee80/worktree.nvim)** -- in-editor worktree switcher I wrote. Hops between repos/worktrees under the directory you opened nvim in, with safety rails on add/remove and ghost-buffer cleanup. Comes with a lualine component and optional LSP re-anchor on switch
- **`utils.go_test_env`** -- reads `.vscode/launch.json` and merges `buildFlags` / `env` / `envFile` into `<leader>dt` so VSCode and Neovim share one source of truth for test debugging. Cached per session
- **[lazysql](https://github.com/jorgerojas26/lazysql)** -- a TUI SQL client hoisted into a floating window via `snacks.terminal`. Pre-configured connections, one keystroke to toggle, and the process stays alive between toggles so you don't pay the connection cost twice
- **11 colorschemes** -- because choosing a theme is a form of self-expression (currently rotating through them like outfits)

## Debugging Go Tests Like a Grown-up

The `<leader>dt` and `<leader>dm` keymaps don't just launch delve — they read `launch.json` from your project, pull out `buildFlags`, `env`, `envFile` (and for main-program debug: `program`, `args`, `cwd`), and feed the resolved config to the delve run. Same file VSCode reads, so teammates on either editor share one config.

**Multi-config picker.** If `launch.json` has more than one `type=go, mode=test` (or `mode=debug`) entry — e.g., one per `cmd/*` entry point, or separate test configs for different build tags — you get a `vim.ui.select` picker on first use. The pick is cached for the session, keyed independently per mode. `:GoTestEnvPick [test|debug]` clears just the pick; `<leader>dL` (or `:GoTestEnvReload`) clears the file cache AND all picks.

**Worktree-aware launch.json lookup.** Resolution walks upward from cwd, stopping at the first `.bare/` or `.git/` directory it encounters (project boundary). That means you can park one `launch.json` at the project root (next to `.bare/` or `.git/`) and every worktree inherits it — no copy-paste per branch. `${workspaceFolder}` still resolves to the current worktree's cwd, so `envFile = "${workspaceFolder}/.env"` gives each worktree its own env. A worktree-specific `.vscode/launch.json` overrides the shared one by winning the upward walk first.

**Scaffolding.** Run the `/go-test-env` Claude skill, answer a couple of prompts for build tags and env vars, and it writes strict JSON to `./.vscode/launch.json`. Existing Go configurations with the same name are replaced in place; everything else is preserved.

Typical test-debug flow:

1. `/go-test-env` — prompts for `-tags=integration,gold`, `TEST_PGURL`, etc. Writes launch.json.
2. Open the test file, drop a breakpoint with `<leader>db`, cursor inside the test.
3. `<leader>dt` — delve launches with the merged env, breakpoint hits, dap-view pops open.
4. `<leader>de` on any expression to live-evaluate. `<leader>dw` to watch something across frames.
5. `<leader>dT` re-runs with the same config. `<leader>dq` terminates.

Typical main-debug flow (multi-entry-point repo):

1. Add one `mode=debug` entry per `cmd/*` in `launch.json` (`"program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/http"`, etc., each with its own `args` / `envFile`).
2. `<leader>dm` — picker shows all main-program configs. Pick one; delve builds + launches it.
3. Subsequent `<leader>dm` presses in the same session reuse the pick (no prompt). `:GoTestEnvPick debug` to re-prompt.

## Worktree Switching Without Rage

If the directory you opened nvim in contains multiple git repos (or a bare repo with a pile of linked worktrees), `<leader>gw` fans them all out in a picker. Pick one -- nvim's cwd changes, a notification confirms the hop, and you're ready to go. `<leader>gW` takes you home.

Existing `:term` buffers **keep their own pwd**. That's not magic; it's just how POSIX processes work -- each shell inherited nvim's cwd at spawn time and is now an independent process. So your long-running `go test -watch` in terminal A doesn't get yanked around when you jump to a different repo in terminal B.

The picker uses `git worktree list --porcelain` under the hood, so both plain repos and bare-repo layouts with linked worktrees are handled. Bare repos themselves are skipped (you don't cd into those). Branch names show up in brackets; the active cwd gets a `●` marker.

## SQL Without Leaving Neovim

`<C-q>` drops [lazysql](https://github.com/jorgerojas26/lazysql) into a lazygit-style floating window. First press boots the picker with your configured connections; subsequent presses hide/show the float while the process keeps running in the background -- so reconnecting to prod is a one-time cost per nvim session.

**Requirements.** Install the binary on your system (pick your flavor: `yay -S lazysql-bin`, `go install github.com/jorgerojas26/lazysql@latest`, or grab a release from the repo). The nvim side is just a `snacks.terminal` toggle -- no plugin to install.

**Connections.** Connections live in `~/.config/lazysql/config.toml`. One `[[database]]` block per entry; lazysql reads the file on launch. Keep the file `chmod 600` since the URL embeds credentials.

```toml
[[database]]
Name = 'My Prod DB'
Provider = 'postgres'
DBName = 'myapp'
URL = 'postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/myapp'
ReadOnly = false

[[database]]
Name = 'Local'
Provider = 'postgres'
DBName = 'dev'
URL = 'postgresql://root:secret@localhost:5432/dev?sslmode=disable'
ReadOnly = false
```

Set `ReadOnly = true` on anything you'd rather not fat-finger a `DELETE` into. Supported providers include `postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlite3`, and a few others -- check the [lazysql repo](https://github.com/jorgerojas26/lazysql) for the full list.

**In-app keys worth knowing.** `?` opens lazysql's own help panel, but these are the ones you'll actually use:

| Key | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `H` / `L` | Focus sidebar / focus table |
| `j` / `k` | Move down / up |
| `/` | Filter / search |
| `c` | Edit cell |
| `o` | Insert new row |
| `d` | Delete row |
| `y` | Yank cell value |
| `Ctrl+E` | Open the SQL editor |
| `Ctrl+R` | Execute query |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save pending changes |
| `<` / `>` | Previous / next page |
| `J` / `K` | Sort descending / ascending |
| `z` / `Z` | Toggle JSON viewer for cell / row |
| `E` | Export to CSV |
| `?` | Help / full keybinding list |
| `q` | Quit lazysql (kills the process -- prefer `<C-q>` to hide) |

Hitting `q` exits lazysql and drops the connection. Use `<C-q>` instead to tuck the float away while leaving the session alive.
